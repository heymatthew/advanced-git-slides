						## Rough Timeline
						9:30 - 12
						- Setup and Overview
						- Personal Workflows

						12:30 - 5
						- Team Workflows
						- Release workflows

						Tomorrow Onsite for Help

						## Why Git?
						* Flexability
						* Tooling
						* Speed
						* Momentum
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## SVN Comparison
						* Decentralised, every clone is an entire copy
						* Branches contain entire history
						* Git tracks content
						* SVN tracks deltas
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						Git thinks in Snapshots, Not Differences

						> The major difference between Git and any other VCS (Subversion and friends included)
						> is the way Git thinks about its data.

					<section data-markdown>
						## Setup

						Git

						https://git-scm.com/download/win

						Tortose Git

						https://tortoisegit.org/

						Git pad

						https://github.com/github/GitPad

						Yes! "...use gitpad as your default editor for git"
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Configure
						```bash
						git config --global user.name "Matthew B. Gray"
						git config --global user.email "code@matthew.nz"
						git config --list
						git config --list --show-origin
						```

						--global stores your global settings

						Default puts settings into your repo
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Docs
						For help on git config, git has a help page
						```bash
						git help $command
						git help config
						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Exercise
						- Using `git help`, pull up pages on `git config`
						- Use help to find out how to unset `user.email`
						- List configurations with `--list --show-origin`
						- Open your .gitconfig file, how are fields saved?
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Personal Workflows 1
						- Immediate productivity: Build and commit to repos
						- Anatomy of a commit: Fields and behaviours
						- Staging files: Steps leading to a commit
						- All about Branches: Create and delete branches
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Immediate productivity
						Create a git repo

						```bash
						mkdir test
						cd test
						git init
						git status
						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Immediate productivity
						Adding and resetting files in the staging area
						```bash
						git status
						git add myfile.txt
						git reset myfile.txt
						git status
						```

						Whole directories too
						```bash
						git add .
						git add myfolder
						git reset myfolder
						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Immediate productivity
						Commit your staged changes
						```bash
						git commit
						```
						Save with an empty file and git will abort
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Immediate productivity
						Delete a git repo

						```bash
						rmdir /S .git
						git status
						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Exercise time!
						Create a repo and commit to it
						```
						mkdir test_repo
						cd test_repo
						git init
						git add
						git commit
						```

						HOT TIP

						Set verbose on commit and commit another file
						```
						git config --global commit.verbose true
						git add
						git commit
						```

						What shows up in the commit message?
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Exercise time 2!
						Lookup help pages on git commit
						```
						git help
						```

						Based on help hints, remove a file and commit
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Anatomy of a commit
						Commits are
						- Immutable
						- SHA1 Hashed
						- Built on
							- File contents
							- Timestamp
							- Author
							- Parent or parents
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>One more time in context</p>
						<div>
							<img src="images/branches-commits.png" alt="git history">
						</div>
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Anatomy of a commit
						Commits can be seen with
						```
						git show
						git log
						```
						And referenced by
						- Hash
						- Branch
						- HEAD
						- Relative to other commits
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Anatomy of a commit
						Looking at a commit
						```
						git show
						```
						```

						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Anatomy of a commit
						Lets talk about immutability!
						* Nodes represent diffs with respect to each other
						* Nodes represent entire file tree on their own

						Point to nodes with...
						* **branch**			- a name to track your work
						* **tag**					- a label, it doesn't move
						* **commit hash**	- complete history and set of files
						* **HEAD**				- your current checkout
						* **$ref~**   		- above are $refs, chain ^ or ~ to go up a branch
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Exercise time!
						What is the difference between
						```
						git show
						git show HEAD
						git show master
						```

						You can get at relative commits by appending ~, try it
						```
						git show HEAD~
						git show master~
						```

						Find the parent commit with `git log`

						Make log show all but the last commit with `HEAD~`

						What does `git log --stat` do?
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Exercise time 2!
						Take the hash from
						```
						git show
						```

						Pass it to `git log` and `git show`
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Staging files

						![staged, unstages, commits, and stashes](images/staging-area.png)

					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Typical git workflow</h3>
						<img src="images/individual-workflow.svg" height="500" alt="personal workflow">
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Staging files
						Lets talk about Test Driven Development

						1. write test, RED
						2. git add
						3. write code, GREEN
						4. git add, git commit
						5. REFACTOR
						6. git commit
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Staging files
						Audit your work interactively with your staging area
						```
						git add -p
						```

						Unstaging files can be done in parts too
						```
						git reset -p
						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Staging files
						If you want to reset to a GREEN state
						```
						git checkout .
						git checkout myfile.txt
						git status
						```

						This doesn't affect added files
						```
						git add -p
						git checkout .
						git status
						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Exercise time!
						1. Make changes to 2 files already committed
						2. Change 1 of them
						3. Checkout everything
						```
						git checkout .
						```
						What changed?

						How could you get rid of your staged changes?
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## All about Branches
						Master is the default branch in git

						Create branches with
						```
						git branch mybranch
						```

						Checkout branches with
						```
						git checkout mybranch
						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## All about branches
						![](images/branches-typical.png)
						![](images/branches-multi.png)

						Typical branching, images from http://git-scm.com
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## All about branches
						![](images/branches-perspective.png)

						How branches can be used for workflow
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## All about Branches
						List branches with
						```
						git branch
						```
						...list all branches with -a
						```
						git branch -a
						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## All about Branches
						Delete branches with
						```
						git branch -d mybranch
						```
						It complains if this is the only copy, such as
						- When another branch isn't referencing it
						- When it's not shared / pushed

						...use -D to go ahead deleting the only copy
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Exercise time!
						Create and checkout a branch
						```
						git branch
						git checkout
						git status
						```

						Commit to the branch, copy the hash down

						Delete the branch
						```
						git branch -d
						```

						Can you `show` the hash from the deleted branch?
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Exercise time 2!
						Run
						```
						git gc
						```

						Can you still see the hash? Why?
						```
						git help gc
						```
					</section>

						## Personal Workflows 2
						- Searching and Testing: How to find missing stuff
						- Reset the world: Moving branches around arbitrarily
						- Diffs and Commits: Tips for review
						- Merge stuff, break stuff: Integrate your work
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Searching and Testing
						Understanding why something is in it's current form
						1. Avoids regressing your codebase
						2. Lets you know if code is under warantee
						3. Lets you seek out a human when stuck
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Searching and Testing
						* Log - Show commit logs
						* Pickaxe - Search commit diffs for changes
						* Blame - revision and author for lines of a file
						* Headless Checkout - Options for work without tracking
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Searching and Testing
						Regular log
						```
						git log
						```

						Show me contents of patches
						```
						git log -p
						```

						Show me a summary of patches
						```
						git log --stat
						```

						Find changes associated with text in a commit message:
						```
						git log --grep '$search_term'
						git log --grep 'bug#1234'
						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Searching and Testing
						```
						git log -S 'some distinct line that changed'
						git log --stat -S '$racebook_uri_result'
						```
						* Find all the changes to a line in your entire history
						* The pickaxe can help find code that’s been deleted or moved
						* Typically helps you with questions like
						 - What happened to myFabuliousFunc()?
						 - When did $mySillyVariable get referenced everywhere?

						* Works with log, diff, and format-patch
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Searching and Testing
						```
						git blame $filename
						git show $hash
						```
						Ignore whitespace
						```
						git blame -w $filename
						```
						Copy paste detection in a file, and across the repo
						```
						git blame -C $filename
						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Headless Checkout
						Options for work without tracking

						If you're not on a branch, git puts you in a headless state
						```
						git checkout $tag
						git checkout $commit
						git checkout $hash
						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Headless Checkout
						Trying something like this...
						```
						git checkout HEAD~
						```
						Results in something like this...

						```
						You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
						changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
						state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

						If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
						do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

						git checkout -b new_branch_name

						HEAD is now at f4b37d8... CSS: Return values should be numbers
						```
						Which is git being melodramatic
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Exercise time!
						1. Clone jquery repo
						2. Use git log to find fixes to issue #14756
						3. Use pickaxe to find commits that added or removed 'parseFloat'
						4. Try git blame on the README.md file
						5. With this info, when was the Contribution Guides section last modified?

						```
						git clone https://github.com/jquery/jquery
						git log --grep 'asdf'
						git log -S 'asdf'
						git blame $file
						git show $hash
						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Reset the world
						Moving branches around arbitrarily

						```
						git checkout $branch
						git reset $ref
						```

						Same command for repo and staging area
						```
						git reset $ref
						git reset myfile.txt
						git reset myfolder
						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Reset the world
						Backup if you're not sure with a branch
						```
						git branch backup
						git reset $ref
						```

						And if everything goes pear shaped
						```
						git reflog
						```
					</section>

					<section data-background-image="images/oops.gif" data-markdown>
						```
						# Save my ass! What have I had 'checked out' recently?
						git reflog
						git reset REF
						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Exercise time!
						In jquery, from master, create a backup branch

						Run
						```
						git reset HEAD~
						```

						What happened?

						What happens when you use `--hard`?

						Reset to your backup branch

						Run
						```git reflog```

						How else could you put master back?
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Diffs and Commits
						Review modifications to a file with
						```
						git diff
						```
						Review modifications after git add with
						```
						git diff --staged
						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Diffs and Commits
						You can specify ranges with dots to both log and diff

						.. (two dots)
						* differences between two revisions
						* optionally limiting comparison to files/folders

						... (three dots)
						* differences between the *last common ancestor*
						* also optionally limiting comparison to files/folders
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Diffs and Commits
						Differences between your branch and master
						```
						git diff master..HEAD
						```

						Differences added since you branched from master
						```
						git diff master...HEAD
						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Diffs and Commits
						Similarly, differences between your branch and master
						```
						git log master..HEAD
						```

						Differences added since you branched from master
						```
						git log master...HEAD
						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Exercise time!
						In your jquery checkout, diff between 1.1 and 1.2
						```
						git diff 1.1...1.2
						```

						What happens when you pass `--stat`?

						Try with 3 and 2 dots, are they different? Why?

						What happens when you run
						```
						git diff 1.1...
						```

						Repeat with `git log`
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Merge stuff, break stuff
						Check out the branch you want your stuff in, and merge with git merge
						```
						git checkout master
						git merge mybranch
						```

						Or pull other people's stuff into your branch
						```
						git checkout mybranch
						git merge master
						git merge anotherbranch
						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Merge stuff, break stuff
						Source control is about social coding and interactions.

						A conflict should be a conversation. When you see
						```
						CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in jabberwocky.html
						Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
						```
						Get info with
						```
						git status
						git diff
						git blame $file
						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Merge stuff, break stuff
						Markers are usually HEAD and a $ref, where

						1. HEAD is work of yours
						2. $ref is the thing you're in conflict with

						Lets try simulate a merge conflict and get here...

						```
						git status
						git diff
						git blame $file
						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Exercise time!
						In your jquery repo, checkout master and merge in `origin/killphp`
						```
						git merge origin/killphp
						git status
						git diff
						git blame $file
						```

						What files are in conflict?

						What authors need to talk?

						How many commits is origin/killphp from master?
						```
						git log ref1...ref2
						```
					</section>

						## Team Workflows 1
						- Share your work: Team Foundation Server
						- Rebase vs Merge: An argument for clean history
						- Remotes: Lets talk about branches on origin
						- Git ignore: Don't bother tracking the superfluous
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Share your work
						Team Foundation Server
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Rebase vs Merge
						An argument for clean history

						`pull` can create merges implicitly

						`pull --rebase` will use a rebase strategy to get your work copied over

						And you can rewrite your history with `--interactive`
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Rebase vs Merge
						Set up git pull to rebase by default
						```
						git config --global branch.rebase true
						git config --global branch.autosetuprebase always
						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Exercise time!
						1. Clone jabberwocky repo
						2. Checkout 'master'
						3. Delete script tag on line 28
						4. Commit, call it something like FIXUP
						5. Interactive rebase onto the tag v1
						6. Squash your fix with 'Oops' and give it a message.

						```
						git clone https://github.com/heymatthew/jabberwocky
						cd jabberwocky
						git add jabberwocky.html
						git commit
						git rebase v1 --interactive
						git log -p
						```

						...it's as if the error was never there.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Exercise 2
						Now put it back
						```
						git reset origin/master --hard
						```
						When would you choose to do this?
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Remotes
						Lets talk about branches on origin
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Git ignore
						Don't bother tracking the superfluous

						- Git SVN bridge: Local git, remote svn
						- Backups and Mirrors: Keep a copy
						- Changelogs: Share what happened
						- Databases: Logic vs State, State vs Data
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Git SVN bridge
						Local git, remote svn

						https://filezilla-project.org/sourcecode.php

						```
						git svn clone https://svn.filezilla-project.org/svn/FileZilla3

					<section data-markdown>
						## Backups and Mirrors
						There are lots of ways to keep backups
						1. Copy paste a directory
						2. Clone locally
						3. Clone a bare repository
						4. Have a mirror repository sync periodically
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Backups and Mirrors
						Copy paste a directory

						Exact copy including checkout and permissions, can push and pull
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Backups and Mirrors
						Clone locally
						```
						git clone source destination
						```
						* Creates a new directory called `destination`
						* Sets `origin` to your repository
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Backups and Mirrors
						Clone a bare repository
						```
						git clone --bare source
						```
						Creates source.git
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Backups and Mirrors
						Have a mirror repository sync periodically
						```
						git clone --bare --mirror source
						```
						* Creates source.git
						* Copies remotes (upstream, origin)
						* Doesn't track their locations
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Changelogs
						Share what happened

						git commit -S
						```

						Verify
						```
						git log --show-signature
						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Bisect
						Triage when a big was introduced. To start bisecting...
						```
						git bisect start $bad_commit $good_commit
						```
						'Unwanted' behaviour?
						```
						git bisect bad
						```
						'Wanted' behaviour?
						```
						git bisect good
						```
						Tidy up
						```
						git bisect reset
						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						Sometimes it's guess work
						```
						git bisect skip
						```

						Sometimes it's complicated to get back to your guess spot
						```
						git bisect log > bisect.log
						git bisect reply bisect.log
						```
					</section>

							2. Checkout the changes made with git log
							3. Use bisect with v1 and v2 tags as good/bad commits
							4. Find the commit that created the alert
							```
							git clone https://github.com/heymatthew/jabberwocky
							git fetch --tags
							git log -p
							git log --stat
							git bisect start $bad $good
							```

							Mark wanted or unwanted behaviour with
							```
							git bisect good
							git bisect bad
							```

							### Quickly setup local, network accessible repos
							Git just tracks content. All history is stored in .git directory, and sharing
							is just mushing content around in there.

							To modify remotes...
							```
							git remote add $alias $location
							git remote rm $alias $location
							```
							Location can be...

							1. ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/
							1. git://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/
							1. http[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/
							1. ftp[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/
							1. rsync://host.xz/path/to/repo.git/

							### Quickly setup local, network accessible repos
							Share your terrible poetry with your neighbour.

							This is for unauthenticated read-only access.
							```
							cd ~/jabberwocky/.git
							touch git-daemon-export-ok
							git daemon --reuseaddr --base-path=~/jabberwocky/ ~/jabberwocky/
							```
							Where ~/jabberwocky is the jabberwocky checkout.

							When this is setup, exchange details and try clone...
							```
							git clone git://$host/ jabberwocky-neighbour
							cd jabberwocky-neighbour
							```
							or add a remote...
							```
							git remote add git://$host/ neighbour
							git fetch --all
							git log neighbour/master
							git diff neighbour/master master

							### Clean history, rebase verses merge
							* When to merge: If you've pushed it, you can't change things without pain.
							* If you have multiple conflicts, try for a merge
							* Use KISS where possible

							----------------------------------------
							Discuss:
							```
							git pull --rebase
							```
							```
							git config --global branch.autosetuprebase always
							git pull
							```
							```
							git rebase --abort
							git merge --abort
							```

						# Branching Strategies
						Production support: Things that are great for any release strategy
						- Diff between points
						- Reverting commits
						- Reverting merges
						- Logic vs State vs Data
						- Backpatching
						- Bisecting
							-	Straight forward
								- git bisect start HEAD 3.0.0
								- git bisect good / bad / skip
								- git bisect reset
							- With data state
								- git bisect start 3.1.0 3.0.0
								- git bisect log
								- git checkout REF FOLDER
								- update state
								- git checkout -f .
								- git bisect good / bad / skip
							- When you need to come back to something
								- git bisect start
								- git bisect good / bad / skip
								- git bisect reflog

						Release strategies

						Tags vs Branches

						Linear History (SVN-ish)
						- Work on master
						- Branch at release time
						- Cherry pick to master on patch releases

						Merge Forward Releases
						- Branch with scoped work
						- Work on release branch till ready
						- Tag for release

						Feature releases with linear history
						- Branch from production
						- Work till test complete
						- Merge to master
						- Branch at release time
						- Merge to release branch for hotfixes
						- Merge release branch into master on hotfix release

						Feature Based Releases
						- Branch features from Production
						- Work till ready, merge releases back into your branches
						- Create release candidates by octo merging heads

						Microkernel Architecture
						- Either break your repository up and use package dependencies to manage code
							- git mv $file $folder
						- Or break your repository up using folders, and manage your dependencies with something like docker tags
						  - git tag
							- git filter-branch OR git mv $file $folder
							- great for controlling commit access and security requirements
							- e.g. banking APIs

						### Database patching on branches
						Git doesn't care about non-filesystem entities

						Database patching is important to get right

						----------------------------------------

						You can either use convetion, or process to manage this

						1. Numeric patch - set 1+$current in your filename
						2. Automatic numeric patch - use a merge script on release
					</section>

							### Strategies for dealing with release requirements
							The battle of flexability vs simplicity

							----------------------------------------

							* Track changes, find bugs and release when you can
							* Working on releases in parallel
							* Construct release candidates based on feature sets
							* Release partial applications (modular)

							### Release requirements: Linear history
							* Simple
							* Track changes, find bugs and release when you can
							* Easy to bring new devs on board

						<div data-markdown>
							### Release requirements: Merge forward releases
							* Fairly simple
							* Work on multiple releases at the same time
							* Can work on upstream while downstream is still going

							![](images/release-branches.png)
						</div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<div data-markdown>
							### Release requirements: Feature releases
							* Every piece of work is a feature
							* Features are octo-merged into a release candidate
							* Need to track production somehow
							* Cannot release 'backwards'

						<div data-markdown>
							### Release requirements: Microkernel architecture
							* Difficulty is abstracted to the application
							* Modules of application can be worked on at the same time
							* Release would package together multiple pieces of work
